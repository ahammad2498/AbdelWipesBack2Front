In this part of the lecture we will learn about the following topics:

1. How to carry out basic numerical summaries on variables within data frames.

2. How to obtain numerical summaries on subsets of data frames (while practicing more subsetting).

3. Additional information about library packages and how they provide additional functions that we can use.

4. How to generate some commonly used plots in R.

&nbsp;

There is a practicum section where you will practice everything you learned in all three portions of Lecture 02.

# Basic Numerical Summaries



.VTorangebold[Make sure that the blood brain dataset is loaded into R before proceeding.]

```{r}
# We learned how to read in data from a .csv file in the previous portion of the lecture. Do the following.
brain <- read.csv(file = "data/bloodbrain.csv", header = T)
```

Most of the basic numerical summaries have obvious names.  If we want to get the mean, sd (standard deviation), and more for variables we can use the same basic pattern.

```{r, R.options=list(width=150)}


# The mean of the Liver variable observations from the brain data.frame
mean( brain$Liver )

# The standard deviation of the Liver variable observations from the brain data.frame
sd( brain$Liver )

# There are short-cut functions that do a lot of the basic work for us too such as summary() which provides 5-number summaries 
#  (plus the mean) for numerical observations and frequency tables for categorical observations.
summary(brain)

```


---

Don't forget that not all variables are numerical, we have different types of summaries for categorical data.


```{r}
# We see that the Sex observation is a categorical variable.
brain$Sex

# We can make a table of counts (aka, absolute frequencies) with a number of functions, the easiest is table()
table(brain$Sex)

# We can make a relative frequency table a number of ways too.
table(brain$Sex)/length(brain$Sex)

# Or equivalently
prop.table( table(brain$Sex) )

```



---



# Practice Using Numerical Summaries and Logical Subsetting

Try out the following for yourself and read the comments for explanations.

```{r}
# How can I get the mean of the tumors when the treatment is BD?

# Think about this in steps.

# First, I want just want the Treatments that correspond to the BD treatment
brain$Treatment == "BD"

# If I use the above logical statement as an index, then I can can get the Tumor measurements for 
#  rats who were given the BD treatment
# Note we don't have to use which() every time, the TRUEs are the only locations used.
brain$Tumor[ brain$Treatment == "BD" ]

# Now we can take the mean of the Tumor measurements for rats who were given the BD treatment.
mean( brain$Tumor[ brain$Treatment == "BD" ] )  

# The last line gives the answer we want and you'll eventually memorize the pattern

```




---

# Advanced, But Very Useful: The apply() Family in R

* There are other useful functions either in Base R or in library packages that we can use that might be more efficient.

* The `apply()` family is used for quick aggregation and numerical summaries.  Let's just focus on the `tapply()` function for now. You can read more these functions here: [r-apply-functions: https://www.guru99.com/r-apply-sapply-tapply.html](https://www.guru99.com/r-apply-sapply-tapply.html)

Usage:  `tapply( numerical_variable,  categorical_variable,  function_name )`

```{r}

# Find the means of the Tumor measurements broken down by the different Treatments
tapply( brain$Tumor, brain$Treatment, mean)

# Find the standard deviations of the Tumor measurements broken down by the different Treatments
tapply( brain$Tumor, brain$Treatment, sd)

# Find the five-number summary for the Tumor measurements broken down by the different Treatments
tapply( brain$Tumor, brain$Treatment, quantile)

```

# More about Library Packages

---

class: middle

* There are many more statistical methods than what you learned about in your first couple of Statistics courses.

* Many of these methods are built into Base R, however there are many library packages that contain additional functions and datasets that we can download and make use of.

* Often times, the new functions are written to do specific tasks in either different and/or more efficient ways.

.VTorangebold[Let's practice.]

Our goal is to install `psych` library package.

* I will demonstrate how to use some point-and-click method to do this for you in a short video clip.

  - This generally involves you going to the Packages tab in the bottom right quadrant and clicking "Install" and it will open a dialog box where you can type the name of the package you wish to install.

  - In general, I advise you to use the point-and-click method for installation of packages, especially if it's your first time installing a package.  Go ahead and accept the defaults if it asks you questions.

* Alternatively, we can install packages using a function like the one you see below but you never really need to.

The following is a way to install the `psych` library using the Console command line.  You only need to do this once.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("psych")
```

* Once installed, to enable a library package you can use the point-and-click method or type the Console command line.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("psych")
```



---

Make sure that you have installed and enabled the `psych` library. 

The point-and-click method requires clicking the Packages Tab and checking the selection box next to `psych`.

```{r R.options=list(width=150)}
# The command line in this case is generally preferred though.
# You generally only need to do this once after R has been opened.
library(psych)   # require() also works but I advise using it for reasons I won't get into.
```


We can learn about a library package by looking at the help.  This generally lists some information about who wrote the library, and what functions and datasets are contained within.

```{r eval=FALSE}
? psych
```

The `describe()` function is a function that we obtained by downloading and enabling the `psych` library.

```{r R.options=list(width=150)}
# Provides a lot of different times of numerical summaries
describe(brain)  
```

We will download other libraries throughout the course.

# Numerical Summaries on Subsets of Data Frames

* We can use logical operators to subset our data frames into very specific cases.

# Subset the BD treatments AND just the Males
subset(brain, Treatment == "BD" & Sex == "Male")

tumor_weight_BD_df

# On the previous slide, we saw the & can be used as an intersection condition, that is, 
#  we want condition 1 & condition 2 to be satisfied.
# Hence, TRUE is both conditions are satisfied, FALSE otherwise.
brain$Treatment == "BD" & brain$Sex == "Female"

# We also use a union condition, i.e. we want either condition 1 or condition 2 (or both) to be satisfied. 
#  The notation for "or" is the | symbol.
# Hence TRUE if Treatment is BD or Sex is Female or both are true.  
#  Otherwise, FALSE (Males with NS treatment)
brain$Treatment == "BD" | brain$Sex == "Female"

brain$Time

InsectSprays is a built-in dataset that compares the efficacy of different types of insect sprays.

```{r}
data(InsectSprays)
```

.VTorangebold[Answer the following questions using functions your learned in this lecture and interpret if neccessary by typing a comment.]


1. What is the structure of this data set?

2. Use the help to describe what the variables represent.

3. Find the mean count regardless of the the spray type

4. Find the 5 number summary for the count regardless of the spray type.
  - Additionally, find the 58th percentile of the count variable using the `quantile()` function. Use `? quantile` if lost.

5. Generate a relative frequency histogram with 10 breaks for the count variable. Label aspects appropriately. Feel free to customize it further if you like.

6. Make a boxplot for all of the count data, are there any outliers?

7. Make side-by-side boxplots where count is the response variable and spray type is the explanatory variable.  Use a different color for each boxplot.

8. Use the `tapply()` function to find the mean and the standard of the counts for the different types of Sprays.
  - Compare this with just using the `mean()` and `sd()` one at a time for each spray type.

9. Use the `subset()` function to return a data frame that consists of only the "C" spray.

10. Use indexing along with logical operators to find the mean count when the "D" spray was used.

**11.** Suppose sprays A and B are actually the same spray.  Ooops!  How can we combine their observations to get the correct mean?

There are many ways that this can be done.  The easiest is to notice that all of the observations are grouped. All the A's occur first in the data set, then the B's, etc.  

In practice the observations are usually scrambled (order in which they were collected).  So we should use logical operators to find all of the observations from sprays A and B.

Let's scramble the data so that we are forced to search properly and then obtain our final goal.


```{r eval=FALSE}
# To help you practice this honestly, let's scramble the dataset
set.seed(0)
q <- sample(1:72)
myinsectsprays <- InsectSprays[q, ]
View(myinsectsprays)  # We can see that the rows are scrampbled by looking at the dataframe again.
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Now obtain the mean of the count for the combined observations from sprays A and B.
# This is a bit longer than necessary, but might help you if you get stuck.
myindex <- c(which(myinsectsprays$spray == "A"), which(myinsectsprays$spray == "B"))

# Now we can take the mean doing the following:
mean( myinsectsprays$count[ myindex ] )

# A more efficient way is to do the following:
mean( myinsectsprays$count[ myinsectsprays$spray == "A" | myinsectsprays$spray == "B" ]   )

```

Study the above and try to understand what's going on.
